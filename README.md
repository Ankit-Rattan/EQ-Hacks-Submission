## Inspiration
The Kavad Yatra had started, where many people set their way to worship the lord. In between their route, they need a different basic facility which is provided by many organizations, but during this season only. There are other people also, like nomads and enthusiast travelers who need basic services and they are available but limited to certain places only. Our primary objective is to provide them with a basic family and extent the same to common people.
## What it does
In our platform we divided into major two sections one is a provider and the other is the seeker. The third section is also there which is NGO, which has its role sometimes as provider also. So, as the name suggests, seekers which include nomads, travelers, and people who need basic services in a certain place either free or paid- "_Our primary moto is to provide services free only as our name suggests **Seva-Shakti**_".    Provider which may include other common people who are interested in providing basic facilities like shelter, food, amenities, etc. either for free or paid depending upon his/her own choice. The provider can also be certain organizations like NGOs or restaurants, and hotels, to serve for the same.
Our exclusive platform will act as a common connection between the seeker and provider.
## How we built it
Th every first step is the establishment of the connections between the seeker and the provider. We built our whole project which is a website using HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript. In order to make the platform more engaging and personalized, seekers and providers can chat with each other with the help of the chatting system provided on the platform itself. Also after connection, the seeker can take help of the map provided on the page powered by Google Maps. To avoid spam, a report section is added. Also to maintain the enthusiast providers, there is a credibility criterion in the system. The most credible provider will get rewards which may include financial aid from the NGO which is also connected through our platform. 

## Challenges we ran into
The very first challenge is the management and flow of the project. The idea that we got is so **unique** that we could find any example for the same. So for the basic idea and flow, we took the example of various NGO website which is closest to our approach.

Second, is the connection between the provider, seeker, and NGO. Thinking of connecting them in a simple manner is itself complicated and we in the end completed it and made it up.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The first thing that we're proud of after completing the project is the completion itself, as we didn't have any idea about the working and flow of the project that should be done. But we managed to do so and completed it in a given time. 
Second, is the idea, as we said it itself is so unique that after each step we have to frame our own path as we don't have any preset example in front of us which is a challenging and interesting part of this project.

## What we learned
There are many things that we have learned from this project. 
- The way to give the proper Hackathon is the very first experience for us. 
- Writing more optimized and at the same time efficient code for the given situation. 
- Getting deep in a particular section of society is very unique for us.

## What's next for Seva-Shakti
Our vision is to implement it in a practical manner. As we said, this concept is new and needs to be there for the overall development of society.
